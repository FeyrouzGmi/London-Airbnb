# London-Airbnb
# Motivation:
London is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world and was ranked as the most visited city in the world with over 65 million visits.

It is a very expensive city to visit, while there are a lot of hotels, Airbnbs can be a more affordable and unique alternative.
But what are the factors that influence Airbnb prices? How the Airbnb prices differ from neighborhood to another?
